				<h2>Information</h2>
					<p>Hazelnuts are wonderful little nuts, and have plenty of health benefits. Great protein, plenty of fiber, and they're scrumptious to boot!</p>

					<p>The hazelnut plant is a tree that wants to be a bush. Left by itself, it develops into a cute little plant, suitable for home gardens. Trimmed and maintained properly, however, they can grow into big trees, producing countless nuts. </p>

					Sweeter than a walnut, crunchier than a cashew, and healthier than a peanut, the hazelnut brings a lot to the table.

					<p>They have many uses, too. Roasted hazelnuts are delicious, and are even better covered in chocolate. Blend them into a butter, easily spread on bread for a great breakfast. Or, grind them up and top your desserts!</p>
