				<p>A hundred years ago, a humble family travelled from Virginia all the way to the great state of Washington. They purchased a plot of land, and through hard work and dedication, they turned it into a successful farm. The very same family is maintaining and working the land, even after all these years. </p>

				<p>These days, our land is serving the purpose of growing hazelnuts. Every year we plant more hazelnut trees, and every year our crops grow stronger and healthier. We take pride in every nut we grow, and take all measures needed to ensure freshness, quality, and taste.</p>
